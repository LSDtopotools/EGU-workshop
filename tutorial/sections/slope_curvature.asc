== Getting slope and curvature maps

Now we'll do some basic topographic analysis using our program *lsdtt-basic-metrics*. This program can extract topographic metrics like slope, aspect and curvature. The program is intended for everyday data processing. A number of these operations are available in GIS software, but we tend to prefer *LSDTopoTools* because the slope and curvature metrics in typical GIS software only uses information from the nearest pixels. We fit a polynomial surface from a neighbourhood of pixels. See http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JF002057/abstract[Hurst et al., 2012, DOI: 10.1029/2011JF002057] and https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/4/627/2016/[Grieve et al., 2016, doi:10.5194/esurf-4-627-2016] for the rationale.

=== Parameter files

Similar to the channel extraction, we also need to define a parameter file for running the slope and curvature analysis.  An example for our DEM is shown below, which again needs to be in the same directory as the DEM:

----
# Parameters for extracting simple surface metrics
# Comments are preceded by the hash symbol

# These are parameters for the file i/o
# IMPORTANT: You MUST make the write directory: the code will not work if it doesn't exist.
read path: ./
write path: ./
read fname: Pozo_DTM
write fname: Pozo_DTM
channel heads fname: Pozo_DTM_Wsources

# Parameters for surface metrics
surface_fitting_radius: 7
print_slope: true
print_aspect: true
print_curvature: true
print_tangential_curvature: true
----

=== Run the code

We run the code to get the slope, aspect, and curvature rasters in a similar way to that of the channel extraction. First we navigate to the directory with the data and then use the appropriate parameter file:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/EGU-workshop/data/Pozo_1m/
----

All you need to do now is call the program with the parameter file as an argument:
[source,console]
----
$ lsdtt-basic-metrics LSDTT_basic_metrics.param
----
This will automatically run the code for you and produce several different datasets. We again have lots of new files that have been created:

[source,console]
----
$ ls
LSDTT_basic_metrics.param       Pozo_DTM.hdr
LSDTT_channel_extraction.param  Pozo_DTM_hs.bil
LSDTT_chi_analysis.param        Pozo_DTM_hs.hdr
Pozo_DTM_ASPECT.bil             Pozo_DTM_ingestedParam.param
Pozo_DTM_ASPECT.hdr             Pozo_DTM__qq.txt
Pozo_DTM_AT_CN.csv              Pozo_DTM_SLOPE.bil
Pozo_DTM_AT_SO.bil              Pozo_DTM_SLOPE.hdr
Pozo_DTM_AT_SO.hdr              Pozo_DTM_TANCURV.bil
Pozo_DTM_ATsources.csv          Pozo_DTM_TANCURV.hdr
Pozo_DTM.bil                    Pozo_DTM_W_CN.csv
Pozo_DTM.bil.aux.xml            Pozo_DTM_W_SO.bil
Pozo_DTM_CURV.bil               Pozo_DTM_W_SO.hdr
Pozo_DTM_CURV.hdr               Pozo_DTM_Wsources.csv
----
The slope, curvature, and aspect rasters are named in a self-explanatory fashion, for example `Pozo_DTM_SLOPE.bil` is the slope raster.  You can load these into your chosen GIS and take a look at them.
