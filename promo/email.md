Subject: EGU workshop on Reproducible Topographic Analysis Using LSDTopoTools

Dear Colleagues,

If you are attending EGU this year, please consider coming to our workshop on reproducible topographic analysis using LSDTopoTools. LSDTopoTools is an open source software package used to analyse landscapes, with applications in geomorphology, ecology, hydrology, soil science, and planetary science. During the course, attendees will gain hands on experience in performing common analyses on topographic datasets, learn about more advanced techniques provided by the software, and will have the opportunity to discuss their research with lead developers and users of LSDTopoTools.

The workshop is on Monday the 8th April between 16:15 and 18:00 in room -2.62, full details can be found here: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/30932

Attendees are required to bring their own laptop which is running MacOS, Linux or Windows 10. You will need to have GIS software installed to visualise your results, we recommend QGIS, but any GIS package will do. If you already have Docker installed it will save some time, but we can help with this if not.

There is no need to register for the workshop, but it will be useful for us to know who is planning to attend, and what type of computer they will be bringing. We therefore ask that you fill in this short form to provide us with this information: https://forms.gle/43qKZZns3FGB9wj19

Looking forward to seeing you there,

Stuart, Fiona and Boris
